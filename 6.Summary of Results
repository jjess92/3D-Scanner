After completing this build and reveiwing the scan, I was pretty pleased with the quality of the scan. 
Althouh, my knowledge of LIDAR and scanning began here, I still believe this is a great gateway project to understanding LIDAR and 3D scanning.
I found the scanner to be pretty accurate with the datasheet. 
I have included Milestone #2 which is a powerpoint presentation that gives another overview of this project.
In this powerpoint you can view the scan that i made for the assignment.
The sensor was able to detect the amount of reflectiveness for each point so different materials can be identified.
If you view this scan, you will notice that the window in the door does not reflect the signal so it is void. 
The soft backs of the chairs are also non reflective, notice the two at the table and two stacks by the door (right stack having +1 chair).
Not seen in the powerpoint is the wall with the whiteboard. 
Since the white board reflects light better than the painted walls, you can identify where the whiteboard is located on the wall as well.
In the end, I would not use this scanner in industry, as it is now outdated, but this project was a great introduction to LIDAR and 3D scanning.
