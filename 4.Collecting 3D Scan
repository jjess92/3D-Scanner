To initiate a scan, the user must first upload the system code provided.
The code provided is the product of the Scanse Sweep 3D Scanner Git-Hub Community. 
I do not claim rights or credit for the software used in this project but I hope to add to the code eventually (after more deep diving).
If the code provided does not work, follow the link below to find the latest update to the software.

Once the LATEST software is flashed to an SD, insert into the pi and a couple of changes needed to made on the pi.
First connect to the pi and then open a terminal.
Add the code below:

  sudo raspi-config --expand-rootfs
  sudo reboot

Once the pi reboots, the system is ready for use.
(There is also an option to set up a pi from scratch and then upload the libraries individually. I did not choose this option due to time restraints)

To operate the system and perform a scan: 
   1. Connect to pi's wifi connection Pi3-AP via phone or desktop.
   2. Open a web browser and type http://172.24.1.1:8080 into the address bar.
   3. Now the operations screen will show options to scan, test the system, manage files, and shutdown the system.
   
Once I tested the system, I found a room to scan, moved objects to the edge of the room, set up the scanner, and then left the room before starting.
Wait till the scan is complete (the ap provides a percent complete bar) and then navigate to the manage files screen.
Then you can simply download the file formatted in a .csv.
