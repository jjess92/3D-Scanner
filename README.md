# 3D-Scanner
Objective: The objective of this Project is to take a 2D LIDAR scanner, and produce a 3D model/scan. To do this, I started by investigating the Scanse Sweep V1.0. Once I found how the scanner operated, I researched how to make it scan a 3D image. I found that I needed to secure the sensor so that it will scan the Z axis. Then a stepper motor is added to slowly turn the sensor while it is scanning. Once a system is setup to do this, 3D scans are easy to collect.
Next Step: 
The list below will help guide you through my process of thinking and how I completed the objective.
