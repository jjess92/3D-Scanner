Once all of the hardware was shipped and collected, I started on the build and followed the instructions (except the lower housing)
You can find the guide that was used on the Scanse website or follow the link below.

The only alterations that I made to the instructions are as follows;
    1. I did not use the suggested base/lower housing since I could not purchase the suggested battery.
       I used an alterior battery pack and simply set it underneath the scanner while operating.
       I then re designed the suggested housing to be a slim cover for the middle housing.
       
    2. I also used a different USB connector than the one suggested.
       This did not change any of the operations/instructions, but I had to fabricate part of the opening on the middle housing for a proper fit.
       
    3. The last thing I found to make the build a little easier was to strip the USB cable that connects to the Scanse's Serial Adaptor.
       I found that the stiff USB cable insulation was causing issues when the system tried to reach its limits during scans.
       To mitigate this, I simply removed approximatly 2.5 inches of the thick insulation of the USB (leving the insulation on the actual wires).
